      Aries: "Arians can be inspirational, courageous, enthusiastic, original, independent, impatient, aggressive, headstrong, selfish, self-centered, and impulsive. The Arian's energies are directed toward building a new individuality, thus all the Arian's energies are directed towards themself and what they want. An Arian likes roles where there leadership abilities are put on display. Arians have executive and organizing ability which is mainly directed in starting things. Sustaining projects is not their strength, but initiating projects is. The tendency to 'damn the torpedoes' and ram full-speed ahead must be controlled. Arians are capable of great accomplishments if they learn how to constructively use their abundant energies. Arians are naturally enthusiastic and are always ready for activity and competition. They are inspiring to others because of these tendencies. Ideas and creative projects seem to flow from them in a never-ending stream. They are full of energy and never lack courage. Because Arians can be pretty self-centered, they must remember that other people may have good ideas and can assume responsibility and leadership roles, too. The natural tendency for an Arian is to stand alone and do everything themself. But cooperation with others can be very effective in getting things done to the end rather than simply starting things and quitting before completion. Arians have a tendency to start a project, then to suddenly lose interest in it if progress is too slow or things have become too complicated.",
      Taurus: "Taureans are generally strong, quiet, deliberate, practical, exacting, determined, persistent, persevering, compassionate and loyal. They like getting their hands on their work, building things, and seeing the tangible, practical results of their effort. Routine work does not bother them as long as the end result in useful and serves some concrete purpose. Possessions and material things are usually of great significance to Taureans. This is because they don't feel emotionally secure unless they can see and touch the objects they own. This intense need to possess and enjoy with the senses can drive Taureans to be extremely productive or extremely acquisitive. Lesser evolved Taureans can treat people as objects or possessions, thus leading to difficulty in relationships. Taurus people work at a slower pace than most, but they always finish whatever projects they start. Because of this, they are reliable, trustworthy, careful and steadfast. They are better at sustaining what others have started rather than starting things themselves. Taureans can be lead, but never pushed. It takes a lot to make a Taurean mad, yet if they are pushed over the edge, well, all heck can break lose. Simply imagine an angry bull and you know what a Taurean is capable of when he is pushed too far. You know the saying about a bull in a china shop, right? When angered, Taureans need plenty of time to cool down. It is best to just leave them alone. You will know when things are out of their system. With anything Taureans need time to assimilate and mull things over. Don't rush them or push them.",
      Gemini: "Geminians are friendly, clever, talkative, versatile, curious, perceptive, intuitive, and logical. At times they can also be quite contradictory, restless, two-faced, critical, and impatient. Gemini people enjoy and need work that includes a great deal of variety. They love to do several things all at the same time, sometimes making them late for appointments. They abhor boredom. Geminians tend to flit from one experience to another, gathering in all types of information along the way, but seldom getting to the depth of any subject. They go broad and not deep. Persistence is not their strong suit. Gaining knowledge and disseminating it is their real talent. Hence, they make wonderful salespeople or teachers if they stick around long enough to get all the facts instead of only half the story. Even if they do not possess all the facts, since they are never at a loss for words, they will continue with their story as if they did have all the facts. It is important for a Geminian to seek intellectual satisfaction. Mental stagnation turns them off, so they read extensively and communicate widely in order to satisfy this longing for mental stimulation. This discontent can make them either very ambitious, or it can incline them to jump from one thing to another, searching for the greener grass which never appears. Geminians usually think quickly on their feet and have the ability to use the right words in any situation. They possess tremendous wit and a good sense of humor. Other people may have difficulty in keeping up with their rapid change of subjects.",
      Cancer: "Cancerians have a strange way of moving through life in a sideways manner, never approaching life head-on, but always from the side. They generally do not tackle anything straight away, but always from the flank. Emotionally, they are up one minute and down the next. These mood swings are sometimes difficult for others to understand and deal with. Cancerians are tenacious, sympathetic, industrious, sociable, thrifty and protective. They can also be argumentative, sensitive, emotional, martyr-like, intuitive, psychic, and patriotic. Cancerians respond to life through their emotions rather than through their minds. They tend to absorb the emotional vibrations of wherever they're at, so it is important to always be in positive environments. Because they live in their feelings, they unconsciously seek sympathy and attention and affection from others. They have a strong need to feel secure. Home and family bring the highest sense of security. Because of all this, they want to be first with those they love or they are very unhappy. Cancerians must learn to release their loved ones to live their own lives. Cancerians are well-known for changing — their minds, their moods, anything. Since they usually possess a slower moving life force, they are usually less active than others. In order to be active, they must first motivate their mind. In general, they dislike exercise. As a consequence, they may become out of shape and gain weight in later years.",
      Leo: "Leos are dignified, courageous, affectionate, powerful, generous, playful, optimistic, ambitious, loyal, and cheerful. On the negative side, though, they can be quite demanding, intolerant, domineering, lazy, closed-minded, and self-centered. They choose to do things that give them wide scope for creativity, organizing, and leadership. Although appearing strong on the outside, most Leos are inwardly sensitive and their feelings are easily hurt. When this occurs, they can turn on the object of their affection, when their pride is hurt. Leos have a decided flair for the dramatic and they enjoy telling stories, being the center of attention, having a good time, and running the show. Mean and cruel acts are generally beneath them, but they do not hesitate to use force when needed. No matter what their actions, they always have the belief that whatever they do is for the other person's benefit. If a Leo is angered, he immediately goes into his kingly role, 'mounting his throne' and quickly putting the opposition or challenger in their proper place. Leos literally roar at people when they are angry. But once their tirade is over, they forgive and forget and never hold a grudge.",
      Virgo: "Virgos desire purity and perfection in all they are and all they do. They are generally reserved, shy, analytical, discriminating, precise, industrious, systematic, considerate, punctual, and reliable. Virgos are hard workers who usually have a great deal of common sense and are practical, with a flair for detailed work. On the negative side, though, they can also be aloof, skeptical, picky, sarcastic, depressed, critical, pessimistic, whiny, and self-centered. Virgoans are happy when they can work with a lot of details, usually of a technical or analytical nature, in and for the service of others. They do not have to be the boss as service is more important than leadership. Virgoans have curious and inquiring minds, with keen analysis and excellent memories. They enjoy analyzing people, situations, and problems. They always want to know how, why, when and where. It is sometimes hard for a Virgo to relax because boredom is something they cannot stand. They want to be busy, either doing or learning. A Virgoan can generally be depended upon to fulfill a promise. They have a flair for organization and enjoy setting up schedules. There is an inborn love of order and harmony. They are always subconsciously seeking perfection in whatever they attempt. Because they push themselves so hard to be perfect, they have a tendency to look for perfection in others. If they find it lacking, they can become pretty critical and faultfinding.",
      Libra: "Librans like to weigh the pros and cons of a situation before they come to any conclusion. If carried too far, they get to the point where they can't come up with any conclusion, thus they can be very indecisive. They tip the scales one way, then the other, hoping to find the proper balance. Librans have an innate sense of fairness, though, and can be diplomatic, cooperative, helpful, idealistic, sociable, dependent, insincere, lazy and self-indulgent. Librans are happiest when in partnership or in situations where they can adjust or work with human relationships. Pleasant surroundings are important to them. Because Librans enjoy people and human interaction so much, they have a difficult time being alone. Because of this, they need to share their life with someone. Unfortunately, they have a tendency to be 'in love with love', because of their romantic and sentimental natures. Thus, they could rush into marriage without forethought and end up in a difficult relationship. Librans find it virtually impossible to remain emotionally stable if there is discord around them. This leads to their wanting peace at any price, which allows others to take advantage of them. They want to be liked by everyone, sometimes to their detriment.",
      Scorpio: "Two animals are used to represent Scorpio, the eagle and the scorpion. The eagle is capable of reaching great heights because he has mastered his lower nature and overcome his passions and the temptations of the sensual sphere. The eagle has risen above the physical world because he has regenerated himself. The scorpion, however, represents those who have not regenerated their thoughts and actions and are still living degenerate lives. They use their cunning and strike when least expected. These are the ones who satisfy their passions regardless of consequences.Scorpios in general are ambitious, efficient, courageous, resourceful and intuitive. But, they can also be jealous, sarcastic, resentful, stubborn, possessive and vindictive. Scorpio people enjoy impossible tasks. They like work that demands continued, determined effort and intense concentration. They are born detectives. Scorpio gives a strong will and determination to accomplish anything undertaken. Scorpios possess an analytical mind, strong intuition, reasoning powers, perception, long range planning ability, magnetism and energy. Scorpios have very definite opinions. These opinions can be so rigid that no amount of persuasion will make them change their minds. Scorpios make friends easily and give unwaveringly to them. In these relationships, they like to know what your plans are, but, because of their secretiveness, they do not necessarily want you to know what they are planning. They are capable of extreme self-sacrifice for those they love. If any of their loved ones are threatened in any way, they feel that they, too, are being threatened. This causes them to instinctively strike out, either verbally or physically.",
      Sagittarius: "Sagittarians tend to be idealistic, optimistic, dependable, open-minded, friendly, honest and versatile. But, they can also be tactless, irresponsible, showy, boastful, self-righteous, arrogant, quarrelsome, fanatical, dogmatic and dictatorial. Sagittarians like any work where foresight and a willingness to take a chance is offered, while at the same time, they try to avoid detailed work.Sagittarians are usually outspoken, sometimes to the point of bluntness. Simply blurting out their ideas and opinions is due to their never-ending search for truth and wisdom. Others think Sagittarians are pretty tactless and the statement that 'truth hurts' fits their way of thinking. Regardless of their undiplomatic remarks, others instinctively feel as if the Sagittarian means them no real harm and is only interested in raising their consciousness. Sagittarians love the outdoors, large animals, nature and sports. Some have reckless gambling tendencies and will bet it all on the drop of a hat. Travel and even long walks appeal to them because they make the Sagittarian feel free — and he needs to feel free. Sagittarians are philosophical and they want to understand the deeper issues and abstractions of life. They have a certain faith in higher things that generally always keeps them of an optimistic bent, no matter what difficulties are currently besetting them. They want to understand the meaning of life. This helps to keep them growing and expanding, which is something they need to do. This desire for expansion can cause them to overextend themselves with too many activities and to use up their energy too rapidly. They need to take intervals of rest to recuperate between projects.",
      Capricorn: "Capricorns have the desire to climb whatever mountains are necessary and to stand on their own two feet in order to work out their ambitions and their salvation. They are conservative, organized, methodical, traditional, responsible, honest, efficient, patient, practical, authoritative, disciplined, serious and goal-oriented. On the negative side they can be worried, pessimistic, retaliatory, suspicious, stubborn and intolerant. They are happiest in careers calling for organizing ability, integrity and perseverance. They have a fear of failure.Their quiet exterior makes Capricorns appear to be loners. They build a wall of reserve around them in order to protect themselves from the ill winds of the world around them. Nothing gets in the way of their plans and ambitions. They strive for security by holding fast to duty and responsibility. Work is very important to them and they do not take it lightly. Many Capricorns have an inferiority complex and this sometimes is what drives them so hard to succeed. They want to look good in front of the world. Capricorns like to plan their every move, weighing all the pros and cons of any issue in advance. They are dependable, particularly in a crisis. When asked, they give sound, practical advice. They are, as a rule, not aggressive people, and only express hostility as a defense when attacked. At times Capricorns can be very sensitive to hurts and feel alone as if no one understands them. A negative Capricorn will seek retribution for wrongs done him. Capricorns need people, but they have a tendency to isolate themselves from people due to their reserve and fear of being hurt. They can be very loyal to close friends and people they care about. Respect and recognition is important to them. Encouragement and praise are essential for motivating a Capricorn.",
      Aquarius: "Aquarians tend to be friendly, original, intuitive, broadminded, nonconforming, different, independent, freedom-loving, scientific, unusual, and helpful. They can also be impersonal, unpredictable, tactless, rebellious, unconventional, stubborn, rigid, radical, bohemian and eccentric. Aquarians like any work which calls for inventiveness and the detached application of special rules or formulae.Aquarians seek to share knowledge with others in order to bring about a better life for all. Group activity is their customary mode of operation. Helping others so they can help themselves appeals to an Aquarian. Aquarians are friendly, yet detached, they have warmth, yet they seem distant. Although appearing cold or aloof, they are not really indifferent to others. It's just that they are much more concerned with humanity as a whole rather than any one particular individual. Since Aquarians generally do not have large, pompous or stuffy egos, they rarely bother to exert themselves to win approval or compliments. Aquarians get excited about bringing new ideas and methods into old, traditional environments. They are philosophical, visionary and idealistic. Feelings of friendship drive them to try to improve the lot of everyone they can. Sometimes the people they want to help don't understand these new ways and react negatively toward them. Sometimes Aquarians are simply ahead of their time, although sometimes they are just cranks.",
      Pisces: "Pisceans are sympathetic, compassionate, unassuming, idealistic, intuitive, congenial, adaptable, psychic, emotional, creative, secretive, versatile, imaginative and self-sacrificing. They can also be impressionable, indecisive, self-pitying, hypersensitive and changeable. They need to serve others. Pisceans are sentimental and romantic in love. At times they expect too much from others and then feel hurt if the other person doesn't come through for them. They have a strong tendency to place their loved one on a pedestal. This leads to disillusionment when they discover their loved one has faults, too. The symbol for Pisces is two fish going in opposite directions connected by a cord. One fish represents the personality and the other represents the spirit. These two opposing forces operate within a Piscean, causing insecurity and indecisiveness. Handling these forces in a positive manner is very difficult for them. Some will seek to escape these pressures through eating, alcohol, drugs or other excesses. That is what one of the fish represents. The other fish represents the Piscean rising to great heights through self-denial, sacrifice and then ultimate attainment. Pisceans learn through suffering and they need to learn perseverance.Pisceans tend to absorb the information and environment around them. Thus it is important that they surround themselves with uplifting people and circumstances. Pisceans are creative, self-sufficient people whose minds are extremely active, due to their strong imagination, which they can sometimes get carried away with. They sense and feel things that others are not aware of."

      Taurus: "Your emotional nature is steadied and others find this quality soothing in you. You are generally even-tempered and peace-loving and are not easily ruffled or given to emotional displays. You can be downright stubborn at times, especially when it comes to making changes that are emotional in nature or that require emotional adjustment. You seek security and often expect this security to come from materials possessions and resources. Hence, you desire to collect material goods and money. You cling to things from the past or things you are used to in order to find this security. A great deal of affection and closeness is needed by you and this helps to assuage feelings of insecurity. But sometimes you hold onto people much too closely so they feel they can't breathe. You expect loyalty in love and you are very devoted to those you care about. You have the tendency to indulge in sensual comforts and activities. Eating rich or sweet food seems to give you security. You may have a weight problem because of this. Food can become a substitute for emotional satisfaction and love. You are resourceful, determined, and persistent. You perhaps have a green thumb and are good at getting anything to grow and prosper. You are happiest when working with your hands, probably with the earth or things of the earth. You can be lead but never pushed into doing things. You hate and fear sickness and pain. Too great a comfort with the status quo can prevent you from making necessary changes. Don't be too rigid in thought or deed.",
      Gemini: "",
      Cancer: "You very easily respond to the emotional environment in which you are placed. You soak up feelings like a sponge. Perhaps this is why you so easily become moody, irritable and inconstant in thought and feeling. Learning to control your own moods may be very difficult, yet necessary, for you. Your greatest need is to nurture and mother someone or ones. You often appear irrational to others because you can't always explain the reason or source of your feelings. Anyone who lives with you must accept your ups and downs and appreciate your need for times of withdrawal. You are also very sympathetic and understand the unspoken feelings and needs of others. You take slights very personally and though you may forgive a mistake by a friend or loved one, you never forget it. Security is very important to you and you look for it in your home and family life. Your senses and emotions are quite strong and it would be wise for you to listen to your intuitive side as you can be quite psychic. You are very tenacious and you do not give up or let go of things or people easily. Your mother is/was a strong influence for good or ill in your life. You are basically an introvert, but will do whatever it takes to protect and defend your family or loved ones. You tend to be a pack-rat because everything has an emotional memory behind it and you find security in all those memories. Nothing or no one is ever gone if they leave their memory behind. Thus, you can become quite possessive. You have the memory of an elephant, but you must learn to forgive and forget past hurts.",
      Leo: "You are warm, generous, and loving in your affections and you bring out great devotion and loyalty in your loved ones. You want to be worshipped and adored like the king or queen you feel you are. You want and need a partner you can be proud of and your own pride is very important to you. You cannot love someone you don't respect and aren't proud of. It is important to you that you feel recognized and appreciated. Your feelings get hurt when you feel ignored. You dislike emotional games and dishonesty. You are popular, generous, dignified, loyal and ambitious and have a persevering, penetrating mind with leadership and creative ability. You dramatize the events in your life and your feelings. On the negative side, you may be ego-oriented, vain and/or ostentatious with a tendency to wear your heart on your sleeve.",
      Virgo: "",
      Libra: "You are kind, sympathetic, agreeable, optimistic, fair, and very fond of social pleasures. You are a considerate and thoughtful friend, and have a real flair for making others feel accepted and appreciated. At the same time you probably possess good reasoning powers and the ability to form correct judgments. There is love of art and music with perhaps decided ability as a performer. You have a need for people and relationships. You avoid personal confrontations or any expression of intense, unpleasant behavior or emotion. You strive for peace, harmony, and perfect balance. You feel unsuited for menial physical labor and you hate to get your hands dirty. Your desire to be liked by everyone may cause you to seek peace at any price, thus you can be evasive on issues due to your desire to keep the peace. You can be quite vacillating and indecisive. You are much more at odds with yourself than people would guess by looking at you from the outside. It is sometimes very difficult for you to make up your mind because you see all sides of any issue and you always want to be fair. You must learn to stand up for your principles.",
      Scorpio: "You are secretive and inclined to brood in silence over the wrongs that people have done, either in reality or simply in your own mind. The mental and emotional focus may be on sensual things or on sex or death. You find it difficult to trust people as you are suspicious of their inner thoughts and plans. You open yourself up to very few as you do not find it easy to trust others. Allowing yourself to be vulnerable and to relinquish control in relationships is not easy for you. You love with passion and you hate with passion. Everything is done emotionally, with intensity. You can be very jealous and possessive in your relationships. Perhaps your mother was very controlling. You have a habit of holding on to wrongs that have been done in the past and not forgiving nor forgetting, and to keep such feelings to yourself. Guilt, resentment and vindictiveness need to be overcome. You must learn to let go or your health will suffer. Learn to express your feelings outwardly rather than repressing them within. You are not content with superficial appearances and are always probing beneath the surface of things for hidden motives. You have a great deal of emotional depth. The potential for success is great when control and discipline are learned. You are magnetic, energetic, independent, aggressive, patient, and determined. Self-control of the passions is mandatory.",

In addition, you are adventurous, playful, freedom-loving, and always ready for a good time. You rarely allow difficulties to keep you down, for no matter how bleak the past or present, you always expect a better, brighter future. In fact, you are uncomfortable with your own or other people's problems and emotional pain. You often try to cheer up or offer philosophical advice to those who are hurting, but unwittingly you avoid or ignore the emotions involved. Friendship means a great deal to you, perhaps even more than love or romance. For you to be happy, your mate must be your best friend and encourage your aspirations and ideals. You also need a great deal of emotional freedom and mobility. On the negative side, you may be rather intolerant, closed-minded, dogmatic, arrogant, non-objective, risk-taking, or possess a holier-than-thou attitude.",

You seek knowledge, either through reading or conversation, or through travel and talking with the new people you constantly meet. You have so much nervous energy that this can sometimes cause great stress which must find an appropriate release. Exercise is a good way to release this tension. You are clever, witty, and always have a joke or comeback ready for any situation. You love being involved in multiple things at once and this may be a problem ? too may irons in the fire at the same time. You are quick to grasp new concepts and equally quick to lose interest in an idea or project once your curiosity has been satisfied. You like to taste a little bit of everything ? concentration and disciplined study are not your strong points. You are handy with your hands and may be ambidextrous or mechanically inclined. Debate and argument appeal to you. There is a tendency to scratch the surface with the things that strike your interest without learning anything very deeply. This is the jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none position. There is danger, then, of superficiality. Control of thought, word, and action is necessary in order to be successful. Find your focus, stay with it and develop perseverance. Journalism, speaking, teaching, sales, advertising, or writing may appeal to you. Mentally restless, you may change jobs or locations frequently, or do work that involves movement, travel, and variety.

Intellectual abilities and accomplishments without heart or soul mean little to you. You are a sensitive listener and deeply interested in a person's feelings and inner life. In addition to psychology, you are probably drawn to education, art, poetry, music, or mythology. You are shy and somewhat reticent about speaking in public, but you will open yourself up and share your thoughts in small, intimate, little family-type circles of people you know and trust. You perhaps enjoy keeping a diary or chronicle of your thoughts and feelings regarding your day-to-day happenings. Your mind retains and absorbs knowledge easily. You are intuitive, psychic, and sympathetic, yet may become depressed over your own problems and the problems of the world.

You want and enjoy drama in your love life and some grand romantic gesture or extravagant expression of generosity impresses you. You dramatize your emotions. You are honest, frank, attractive, kind, compassionate, and fun-loving with a charming personality. You find it easy to be in love with love.

Vanity and becoming a show-off is possible. You need to be admired for your inner and outer beauty.",
      Virgo: "You are quietly devoted and faithful to your loved ones, and often become a kind of servant to your love partner. You are more comfortable showing love for someone by doing something for them, making something for them, or simply being there for them rather than telling them so in a romantic sort of way. You are somewhat timid about expressing too much sentiment or emotion. You may lack confidence in your own attractiveness and ability to draw love to yourself. This could create doubt of your own worthiness to receive love and appreciation. There is a strong tendency to be very critical of the partner and too expect perfection. Marriage may be delayed due to the desire to find that perfect partner, which does not exist. You desire everything to be clean and orderly around you. A tendency to criticize and nag can be overcome be learning how to serve others in a simple way. You are able to be kind, tender, and sympathetic, thus you may excel at nursing.",

You are attracted to someone who is fun-loving, playful, and open to adventure and new experiences. Traveling together, meeting new people and exploring new vistas is particularly enjoyable. People of foreign background and cultures enlarge your understanding of the world and yourself. You want to be able to share your dreams, aspirations and ideals with your mate. It is very important to you that you have a spiritual or intellectual rapport with your love partner, perhaps more important than the emotional/physical relationship. You are not especially sentimental and your partner may feel that you are too casual and not serious or romantic enough. You are sympathetic, kind, generous and optimistic. You idealize love. Always on the lookout for greener pastures, you may not stay long with a partner who doesn't help you to grow or provide you with enough excitement. You desire to share a love of God, expressed through religious devotion and a love of man, expressed through philanthropy and charity with the one you choose to love.",
      Capricorn: "",
      Aquarius: "Your affections are expressed in an open, unconventional and rather detached way. Socializing, bringing people together and having many friends and acquaintances very much appeal to you. Because you value friendship so highly, you may be more comfortable being a friend than a lover. One thing's for sure ? you highly dislike possessive, clingy relationships. You want to be free to do whatever you want with whomever you like. You want an intellectual or spiritual connection with your partner and this may even be the preferred substitute over a very intimate or emotional bonding. You need a partner who will give you plenty of freedom, allowing you to be your own person, and not be too demanding emotionally. You are charming, happy and original, but also, cool, calm and detached. This detachment is beneficial because you, as a rule, are never possessive of people or things. The feelings you have tend to be filtered through your mind and intellectualized. You need to learn warmth and understanding.",

      Aries: "You are aggressive, pioneering, adventurous, and always on the outlook to start new projects. You hate restraint and don't like to be told to do something or how to do it. You want to lead, not follow. At times you can be headstrong, impulsive, and impatient. Waiting is not something that appeals to you. You go after what you want with great zeal and you do not take no for an answer. You love competition and anything that allows you to test or prove yourself. Cooperation is not your strong suit and you can be very self-willed, self-absorbed, and selfish at times. The me-first attitude is strong in you. You are self-reliant and hate depending or relying on others. You need to be your own person and do things your way, even if it might not be the best way. Your best talent is in getting things off the ground quickly. If initial success does not come quickly, you may get tired of that project and move to the next. Sustaining is not your strong side. Long term efforts are not as appealing to you as quick, short term affairs that you can finish with quickly so you can start something else. Energy and enthusiasm are your strong side. Self-control is important for you to learn so you don't burn out. Physical activity and keeping in shape appeals to you. You may be prone to accidents due to haste. You need to learn to stick to a project until it is finished before rushing off on a new endeavor. You must learn to control your temper and impulsiveness.",
      Taurus: "Once you set your mind on a goal, your dedication, determination, and commitment to it are extraordinary. You never give up and find it difficult to change your mind or course in mid-stream. Whatever you have set your sights on, you refuse to give up or let go of it. You are loyal to a fault, unless someone betrays your trust, then all heck can break loose. You are patient and usually slow to anger unless someone takes you too far. That is when you charge, just like the bull Taurus stands for. You are reliable and consistent and can handle more of the workload than most around you. You prefer a regular routine, with definite hours and clearly defined responsibilities and tasks. You enjoy building and seeing the results of your hard work. Things you can put your hands on appeal to you. You need to see practical results, not theory and you are not satisfied with intangibles like just having a good time. At the same time, you have a lazy, comfort-loving side and there is often a good deal of inertia for you to overcome before you get going. Once you get a momentum going, your energy level is strong and steady. Keeping things going is your strength, especially once someone else starts them. Material well-being and security are large factors in determining what you do. Your stamina and persistence is your great strength but it can also work against you; you can get caught in a rut and refuse to seize new opportunities. You also tend to play it safe and to limit yourself in that way. Change scares you. So does disease and pain. At times you have a decided stubborn streak where no one can reach you. Possessiveness and jealously may cause problems for you in relationships. Money and possessions are important to you for the feelings of security they bring. Re-evaluate your values. Sharing should be cultivated. Your tongue may be quite unruly at times.",

Your ego drive is not very strong and you are not especially ambitious or eager to push your way to the top. Inner satisfaction is more important to you. You may feel inadequate in situations that call for strong, forceful action. But, when you feel your loved ones or your family or anyone you really care about is being threatened, then you will fight and defend with all the tenacity in the world. That brings out the very strong protective side in you. Impulse and instinct take over and you will battle until the end, if needed. Your goals and actions tend to center around your family and loved ones and they are very personal. Great sacrifices can be made for them, even though they may be in the wrong. Being sensitive to stress, you do not handle high-pressure, competitive situations very well. You can be very touchy, moody, irritable and difficult to be around when there are many demands or tensions at work. Your energy level is not constant and is very dependent on your emotional state at the time, especially as regards your emotional harmony or discord at home. You should avoid eating when emotionally upset as this plays havoc with your digestive system. You are hard-working, sympathetic, moody, defensive, tenacious, intuitive, instinctive, sensitive, and perhaps over-emotional. Control of your emotions is important to your health and well-being.",

You often feel that if you want something done right, then you must do it yourself, for others never do as thorough a job as you do. Doing a task well is very important to you, and you may labor over minute details that others wouldn't bother with. You constantly work for accuracy, efficiency, and precision, and you become very irritable when things are not done right. On the other hand, you can become so much of a perfectionist and so self-critical that you will not even attempt many activities and projects, feeling that your efforts simply won't be good enough. You are usually very realistic in assessing what you can accomplish and, if anything, you underestimate yourself. You are good at conserving your energy and pacing yourself so that you do not waste or diffuse your efforts. Sometimes an unwillingness to take risks or venture from the tried, beaten track can sometimes limit your opportunities. You may not aim high enough and may settle for too little in life. You can be a worry-wart and a fuss-budget who gets lost in too many details.",
      Libra: "You swing from being too pushy, aggressive, confrontational, and insistent on doing things your own way to being too eager to please and too compromising. You have a strong attraction to the opposite sex and if Mars is well aspected, then this brings popularity and good will. But if Mars is badly aspected, then this can bring opposition and criticism from the public and the opposite sex, fickleness in love relationships, and trouble from toying with the affections of others. Desire for competition and cooperation swing back and forth. You seek a balance between acting independently and assertively and working cooperatively and interdependently with others. You may feel frustrated at times that you cannot simply do what you want to, that you must always accommodate the needs and desires of others. Or you may feel hesitant to act in a positive, assertive manner if you do not have the support and approval of other people. Either way, you are not a loner. You achieve your goals by collaborating and joining forces with others, by being a team player. You are very concerned with the concept of fairness and become quite vocal if you sense someone is being taken advantage of. You may be attracted to legal pursuits. You avoid extremism and favor a balanced, moderate approach to living. You are unlikely to push yourself too hard or to become fanatically driven to reach your goals. You tend to be persuasive, perceptive, enthusiastic and easygoing, although at times you can be argumentative. Diplomacy and patience may need to be cultivated.",
      Scorpio: "You are extremely strong-willed and you pursue your goals and desires with passionate dedication and determination. You are capable of total concentration and tremendous discipline, and you are very difficult to influence once your mind is made up. When you want something, you can be very one-sided and almost obsessed with it. You tend to be secretive and you do not want others to know what your plans are. You tend to be instinctive, perceptive, determined, strong-willed, stubborn and magnetic. You have deep emotions and may occasionally show a primitive side. You need to learn self-discipline or your desire nature will rule your life, probably causing great sorrow in the end. You must learn to control your jealousy and possessiveness in matters of love. A certain amount of detachment in relationships would probably be good and this, of course, would include your tendency to treat loved ones as possessions. You are very forceful in a quiet and subtle way and others may have difficulty in seeing or understanding your motives. You can manipulate people in a way that is not obvious to them or others. Direct confrontation with others is not your preferred style. You like operating behind the scenes. In any case, you are a formidable opponent when riled. In matters of health, there may be a tendency towards hemorrhoids.",

You are efficient, tenacious, organized, dedicated, practical, disciplined and steadfast in your resolve to feel successful. Your drive and energy are directed toward practical material accomplishment and achieving concrete results. You are hard-working and capable of foregoing immediate comfort in order to achieve your long-range goals. You can easily become a workaholic and are very responsible and conscientious about doing a thorough job. You don't tend to gamble when it comes to implementing your plans but generally prefer the conservative, tried-and-true route and then following through with it. You rely on your own efforts and perseverance rather than luck or good fortune. There is a natural shrewdness and instinct for business or organizational management. You tend to be ambitious, persistent, patient, self-reliant and responsible. You are apt to be slow in learning, but there is total assimilation of knowledge. Your energy is carefully used. Success is very important to you. On the negative side you may have a quick irritability which needs to be controlled and a tendency to feel resentment toward others for supposed hurts.

Forget about pleasing everyone (it can't be done) and instead focus on doing your best. Develop self-confidence and the courage to be different and don't let it get to you. You can be very sensitive to your environment so do not go to places that might bring up ill feelings or bad memories in you. Your sub-conscious is probably very strong and sometimes quite unmanageable. Be less sensitive to the real or imagined slights of the people around you. Stay positive. You can be quite restless and impulsive. Your mother perhaps affected you greatly as you were growing up. Some of your strengths and many of your weaknesses are probably due to this. Her influence is and may continue to be strong, both for good or ill. Concerning vocation: the emphasis is upon your individuality and doing your own thing. Try to find something that allows you to express your own uniqueness within your work. Find something that you can really put your heart and soul into. Without that deep emotional connection you will simply go through the motions and be unhappy in and with your work.",
      2: "You want and perhaps need to possess both money and possessions for your emotional security. Your feelings and emotional well-being are connected with your material resources. Changes and fluctuations will occur in your financial situation. Perhaps you alternate between being thrifty and careless with your money. Concerning vocation: the emphasis here is on self-worth. You need a work structure that allows public view or access, or working with women or the public. Like a pretty piece of jewelry in a department store window, you should be within the public's view while working. This may not entail working with the public directly, however. You feel as if you need to be seen while working. Becoming one with your work allows you to identify personally and emotionally with some life purpose and to project this to the public at large. Because you so closely identify with your work, your ideas of how successful you are as a person are directly tied in with the success you feel at your work environment.",
      3: "You possess intellectual curiosity and may well express your true feelings through speech, poetry or writing. Intellectualizing your feelings is probable. There is a strong need for communication and for gathering information, which is later shared with people in general or women in particular. You have a fine sense of humor and like to joke and play around. Travel appeals to you because it affords new opportunities for learning. Routine of any kind probably bores you and you are constantly looking for variety. Your ideas change at a moment's notice and you are forever flexible and adaptable to any situation. Learning is perhaps better accomplished through listening rather than reading. Your mind can be quite emotional at times. Concerning vocation: the emphasis is on communication and information exchange. Your personality gathers, shares and reacts to information. This position represents the intermediary, the go-between, and the dissemination functions.",
      4: "You have a strong sense of family and home. A love of antiques perhaps grounds you to your roots. Security is very important to you and you seem to get that through your foundations, your home and family, and your parents. Things collected serve as reminders of the past which you maybe try too hard to hold on to. Many changes of residence can occur until you find your personal foundation or roots. One or both parents are strong in your life. Concerning vocation: the emphasis is on the home. Maybe working in your home would be most fulfilling or maybe you simply need to make your place of work very homey, using photographs, mementos, furniture, etc., to establish the most personal atmosphere. The need during work is for security and comfort.",
      5: "Romances and attachments to children can be decidedly emotional. There is a constant search for pleasure and emotional self-expression. Activities concerning children are pronounced. Too much emphasis may be placed upon having a good time and being the center of attention. There are mood swings and fickleness in love affairs. A heightened desire to feel loved and important may need to be controlled. You are a pleasure-seeking person with a lot of charm. Fluctuating emotions may interfere with your creativity. Concerning vocation: The theatrical, exhibitionist, creative dimensions of the work needs are increased. Teaching and taking care of children are emphasized. Speculation and the dramatizing of all experiences are possible.",
      6: "You are considerate of fellow workers and desire to nurture them in a productive work environment. Service to others is a fine outlet for your personality. Moodiness and sensitivity can be a problem, though. Fluctuations in health are possible, perhaps mostly due to worry and feelings of insecurity. Emotional tension along with digestive troubles indicate the need to relax. Stop worrying. You should not eat when overworked, overtired, or when you are upset. Take care of your health and watch your diet. Concerning vocation: You are probably totally absorbed within your work situation. You can be a workaholic. Many job changes are possible and working with the public or with women is indicated.",
      7: "You seem to attract sensitive people as partners, perhaps those who want to mother you or be mothered. There can be many changes of partners and many relationships because of the need to find someone who can bring an ultimate security. This search continues because security can only be found within, not without. You desire companionship, hence many relationships.\r\n\r\nYour feelings are greatly influenced by those with whom you are in close personal contact. You want to be popular with others. You are inclined to seek partners who can bring out your sympathetic side and play on your emotions.\r\n\r\nFor men there is often a tendency to seek a mother figure and to bring out in others a desire to mother, protect and care for them. You are therefore likely to attract a partner who is kind and domesticated.\r\n\r\nBoth you and your partner may need to be on your guard against moody or fickle behavior. Marriage may be undertaken with the object of establishing a home. More than one marriage is possible.\r\n\r\nThere is probably a compelling emotional need for a partner and for marriage. In order to get the best results from any partnership you must learn to control any tendency to be continually at the mercy of your moods, which may result from over-vulnerable feelings. Try to control a tendency to be too dependent on others for your emotional stimuli and you should discipline a constant desire for changes in the nature of the relationship.\r\n\r\nConcerning vocation: Your work situation is tied to the public, partnerships, a keen awareness of public expectation and the need to meet it. Perhaps marriage is essential to give clear focus to work security. For many with this position, the work profile can be labeled a public personality. You are dependent upon others for the fulfillment of work needs. The process of relationships is extremely important.",
      8: "You desire security and perhaps look for it through other people's possessions or resources. You have self-doubt and worry. You may be subject to jealousy, envy and possessiveness. Psychic sensitivity is noticeable and psychic abilities can be developed, hopefully along positive lines. There may be financial gain through a partnership, business or through marriage. You are intrigued by what motivates others. Preoccupation with sex or death can exist for you. Concerning vocation: A work situation dependent upon others' resources is noted. Work involving reform, transformation, rehabilitation, mystery, psychology, playing detective, or research work appeals to you.",
      9: "You are a dreamer and muse often about the higher aspects of life. Since you may not be content with the way your life currently is going, you have the desire to search for fresh fields. This search may take you on many long travels, both physically and mentally. Security may be found in a religious or philosophical ideal. Your philosophy of life is what nurtures you and gives you security. You have a variety of interests, in sports, hobbies and studies. You make a stimulating teacher because of your personal interest in the subjects you teach. They are really a part of you and that comes across to those who listen to you. You may have precognitive dreams. Concerning vocation: the emphasis is placed upon the higher mind, the dimensions of philosophy, public mores, religion, law or sharing the reasoning of the public. Issues regarding foreign travel, relocation, even citizenship change are important dimensions to consider in the quest for work conditions that will bring personal success.",
      10: "What others think is very important to you. A desire for achievement can dominate your feelings. You may hold a public position managing or dealing with change, women or publicity. You have a personal charisma which enables you to influence others. Many changes of career are possible. You feel a need to be socially useful to society. Concerning vocation: You desire a take-charge position within work situations. Your individuality is emphasized, often to the point that no subordinate position within work can be easily tolerated. Your emotions must be controlled.",
      11: "You can be popular with women. Many of your friends will be female. The feeling of belonging to a group increases your feelings of security. If you feel you do not belong, then negative emotions surface that all basically have to do with your own needs for security. Humanitarian projects may be important to you as you can develop your nurturing instincts with or for the group. You enjoy working for the good of the group instead of just your own good. You are responsive to the feelings of others. Concerning vocation: The network of friendships within the work situation is emphasized. Friends may help get the job, make the job rewarding and will probably endure after the job is done. A friend's advice about work opportunity or direction is perhaps more important than that of a professional counselor.",
      12: "You can work behind the scenes in an institution, hospital or jail. There may be dealings with public welfare or those unfortunates of life. Conscious or subconscious sensitivity can be damaging if not held in check. You feel some sort of cross to bear which others may not be aware of and many troubles may occur. Secret enemies may try to take advantage of you. Through suffering comes obedience. Your mother may be of great distress to you. Serving others is the safest, shortest road to God. Teach to others what you have learned through your own suffering. Concerning vocation: You prefer little or no contact at all with the public in your job. Symbolically, this position is the author hidden away in the attic, the playwright who will not attend a performance of his work, the behind-the-scenes person. The personality is hidden and may be limited and confined. In work, these conditions are preferred in order to provide maximum security and comfort to the personality."
    }
    Mercury: {
      1: "You are adaptable, clever, inquisitive, eloquent, witty, and perhaps high-strung. You want to know something about a lot of things. Your speeches and writings reflect your own personal opinions. You may have jittery nerves which keep your body slim, but which could cause nervous disorders. You love talking about what interests you.",
      2: "You may use your wit, knowledge, and versatility to make money. At the very least you like to talk about money – it is on your mind. You may earn money with an ability to communicate ideas to others through writing and speaking. You may have financial skill, but your money may come and go, regardless.",
      3: "You are clever, alert, adaptable, versatile and studious. Mercury here stimulates the mind and the body. You can express your ideas fluently and you have the ability to bring your ideas to completion. You are apt to be a jack-of-all-trades. There may be many short journeys. This is a good position for teachers, for those concerned with detailed work, or for work with computers. Writing or speaking ability is present.",
      4: "You tend to be studious, with literary interests. You like to study at home. Continual studying gives you a sense of inner security. You may be high-strung and need to learn to relax and take a break from all that book work. There can be many changes of residences due to your restlessness and your need to find a place for yourself. Wherever you end up, your home will no doubt contain a study area or a special spot where you can just talk to friends and acquaintances.",
      5: "You have a need to prove your intelligence and to use that intelligence in creating things of a mental nature ? mental children, as it were. You desire to pass on your knowledge to others and to learn from them as well. Teaching children or young adults may provide quite a lift for you. Games of strategy and skill challenge your intellect. You desire to communicate your thoughts in a clever, inspiring and dramatic manner. You may have acting, writing, or speaking ability. As a teacher, you enjoy stimulating the minds of others and encouraging your students to greater things. Romances probably need to involve someone with whom you can communicate intelligently and relate to mentally. For you, sexiness is in the brain.",
      6: "You have analytical ability with a possible love of computers and electronics. If you become too concerned with details, your nerves may become frayed, thus causing health problems. Any ill health reflects wrong thinking and perhaps worry. You may be restless with a desire for frequent job changes. Service, possibly of a mental nature, appeals to you. Variety in your work or workplace is important. Issues of health and diet interest you.",
      7: "Your relationships tend to gravitate towards people who are intelligent, thought-provoking, witty and learned. You desire your spouse or business partner to be sharp, curious, clever and alert. You need to communicate and exchange ideas and information with your partner. Promotion of ideas to and from others appeals to you and you are always up for a good debate, discussion or argument. You may spend much time thinking about your relationship or relationships in general. Marriage may be quite often on your mind. You desire a marriage or business partner that provides you with mental satisfaction and challenge. A partner who challenges you mentally and one who helps you function on more of an intellectual level is what you are looking for and need. Their value is enhanced if they help you better adapt and more effectively communicate with others. The person who gives you a lively flow of ideas, ideas that challenge and test your own mental processes, one who brings out your best mentally, stimulates you in a way that others may not understand. Yet that is what you seek in a partner. Your partner may be quick-witted, fluent, volatile, restless, high- strung as well as outspoken, argumentative, wordy and critical. Nervousness or mental imbalance may be present. Your partner may possibly be connected with education, writing, traveling, sales, language interpretation or clerical, secretarial, typing or computer work. In order to achieve the most positive results from any partnership you should learn to control your argumentativeness and your desire to criticize.",
      8: "You have talent for analysis, research, insight, tax preparation, insurance and perhaps detective work. You want to get to the bottom of who, what, where and why. You are a born investigator. You may tend to worry over fluctuating finances. Watch a tendency to gossip about others.

You have many ideas and beliefs with the ability to express them well verbally. You probably enjoy travel and foreign culture and it is particularly educational for you. You have the ability to learn foreign languages or to be a translator. You may be a teacher or be involved in higher learning in some other way. Interest may exist in publishing or advertising.",
      10: "Perhaps you will write or speak as a career. The teaching profession may hold promise for you. You have the ability to communicate your ideas to others and to be recognized for them. Your manual dexterity and mental alertness may lead you to a field where this is a real necessity. You may have several jobs, as you have a variety of talents. There is a possibility of travel in your profession.",
      11: "You have an original, comprehensive, adaptable and intellectual mind. Your goals are obtained through the use of your mind. You choose friends who stimulate your mind, perhaps younger friends. You find it stimulating to converse with those friends who share opposing views. You could be the spokesman or secretary for your favorite group or organization.",
      12: "You have a perceptive, intuitive and subtle mind with an interest in the metaphysical world. You can absorb knowledge intuitively and you understand more than you wish to divulge. You are secretive and have the ability to understand the deeper meanings of tones of voice and hand gestures. Secret enemies may try to undo you or speak evil of you. You may lack confidence in yourself. You may find yourself limited or incapacitated if you allow your nerves to become too frayed. Be careful of your ears and your hearing, which may be weak."

    Venus: {
      1: "You are friendly and charming with a magnetic personality. You are the honey in life that draws the bees. You always seem to know what to say with regard to what people want to hear. Whether it is the truth or not is the problem. You have an uncanny ability to attract everything you need in life. People and things just come to you. But, you must guard against using people to get what you want. You enjoy and have an appreciation of beautiful and luxurious things. You can also be quite selfish and self-centered. Acting like the spoiled brat is also a danger.",
      2: "You attract money and personal possessions, especially when needed. You spend money as fast as you earn it, sometimes faster. Your hidden talents can be beneficial to others, if you apply yourself. Don't be afraid to work. Your money is used to buy beautiful, artistic, and/or musical things. You like a certain amount of luxury to surround you. Money may come to you through a partner or relationship.",
      3: "You may be artistic and creative in speech and writing and you express yourself well in either. You have a love of travel, yet your immediate surroundings are probably quite harmonious and comfortable. Relations with neighbors and siblings are probably easy-going and pleasurable. Because you dislike inharmony, you avoid confrontations with people in your immediate environment, hating to rock the boat.",
      4: "You desire beautiful things and a nice, rather luxurious home. You have an artistic nature with a talent for making people welcome in your home. Entertaining at home gives you real pleasure. There is a love of family and children. The latter part of life may be pleasant and comfortable, although you may find a tendency to add weight in later life.",

You probably have talent in drama, art, or music and these may be your favorite hobbies. Perhaps there is love of the stage and of performing. You might make a delightful and expressive teacher because of your love of children. You certainly enjoy having a good time and people may consider you a party animal.

This is a fairly good position for health unless you abuse your body through self-indulgence and rich, sweet food. An excess of sugar and starches should be avoided. You can be the mediator when differences of opinion occur on the job or in the office. You can bring peace and understanding.",
      7: "You are charming, sociable and friendly and it is easy for people to see your loving nature. Partnerships are generally happy and harmonious. But your desire for peace and harmony at all costs may be detrimental to you if you do not stand up for your own needs. You desire a spouse who is attractive and probably well off financially. Creature comforts and enjoying them with your partner are desired. Take care that you do not get in the habit of expecting too much from others, though. You have a deep appreciation of the value of relationships. Too great an emphasis on affection might cause problems for you. A desire for the perfect relationship may be so strong that any imperfections in your relationship could be blown up beyond proportion. Balance and poise are necessary. You seek a partner that can supply you with "the good life". You want beauty, luxury and the finer things in life and you seek a partner who can provide these. Perhaps marriage will bring you to a higher station in life. Over-indulgence and over-emphasizing the sensual side of life can lead to problems. You must have a partner you feel is cooperative rather than competitive. If Venus is aspected poorly in your chart, then perhaps your partner's moral standards are subject to question.",
      8: "You may be enjoying physical comforts and prosperity perhaps due to your partner's efforts. You may inherit money which allows you the luxury you seek.

Be careful also of pleasing your friends at a cost to yourself. You have the ability to put people at ease. You enjoy cultural and group pursuits. You have a strong desire to relax with congenial companions, though you can be imposed upon by friends because of your desire to do everything possible for their comfort and pleasure.",
      12: "Your love of solitude and being your own best company may cause you to want to retreat from society. Pleasures are enjoyed in secret or behind the scenes. Clandestine relationships are possible. Self-indulgence through drink, drugs or sex can bring on self-undoing. There is a strong sense of compassion and a willingness to help and serve others.

You desire an active partner who can help you share in the goings-on of the world. Your partner needs to challenge you, help you initiate projects and perhaps compete with you. You need a sparring partner! Your relationships have much energy and you need to channel that energy into constructive means and not into destructive ones. The competition between you and your partner might better be directed towards the outer world.\r\n\r\nIn all your dealings with others you enjoy the element of challenge and competition. You may goad others just to see how they will react. The chase is important to you, perhaps more important then the end result. Because you enjoy the action, you may not mind losing battles to a partner who is prepared to carry the fight to you. Your marriage partner is likely to be very ardent, positive, active, capable and courageous, with a will of their own.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the partner you seek is someone who can play the role of a champion or a crusader.

You have the ability to get others to believe in your expansion-oriented, long-range plans, dreams and visions.",
      11: "You probably have lots of friends who are willing to do almost anything for you, and you for them. These friends are knowledgeable, idealistic and may be of foreign culture or descent. The social life appeals to you and this may be the cause of over-indulgence or over-extravagance on your part which could get you into trouble. You are popular, with faithful and influential friends. You have a natural ability to organize and plan large group activities. You are a strong supporter of groups, foundations and philanthropies.",
      12: "You tend to be philanthropic and have great faith in the future. You may have an angel to watch over you and assist you through any reversals. There is a love of humanity and a great desire to help others, especially those who cannot fend for themselves. Work in a hospital or jail is possible. Success comes in a quiet, unassuming manner in middle life. You can be unrealistic, though. It is important to think all ideas carefully through before carrying them out."
    }
    Saturn: {
      1: "You are probably reserved, quiet, and serious. People may take you for quite a cold person. You are responsible, hard-working and duty comes first on your list of priorities. Self-controlled and disciplined are how others see you. You may have experienced a rather austere or difficult early childhood. Perhaps there was illness that kept you on the sidelines. Feelings of inferiority, insecurity, or unworthiness may push you to great ambitions and accomplishments. Perhaps you feel unloved or that you are not worthy of love. These feelings may have been activated in your early, formative years. Pessimism and depression may come upon you because everything looks like such a struggle for you. Keep your chin up and realize that no hard work is ever wasted and that rewards will come to you later in life if you buckle down now and toe the line. Survival issues may come into play.",
      2: "You tend to be thrifty, practical and responsible, especially with money and possessions. This placement does not deny money, but you must work hard for it. Sometimes you are so busy squirreling away money that you forget to enjoy it. Having money set aside for a rainy day is fine, but you probably don't need as much as you tend to want to have set aside. Poverty is possible with this placement due to a lack of understanding of the true value of money and possessions. There is a tendency to become depressed over material matters. Your possessions are apt to bring worries rather than happiness because you may need to learn to share with others. There may have been too much emphasis on materialism in past lives. You may need to re-evaluate your values. Attitudes of possessiveness toward others must be changed. Feelings of being unloved, unwanted, and unappreciated occur with this position. You must value yourself before others can value you. Love yourself first.",
      3: "Your mind is serious, exacting, patient and orderly plus you have the ability to concentrate on deep subject matter. With this ability comes a tendency to depression, pessimism, loneliness or despondency. You have organizational ability and are probably conservative and traditional in your thinking. Mathematics and strategy games may appeal to you. Time consuming projects do not bother you. You may feel a bit isolated from siblings and neighbors or they may give you trouble. There may be issues of communication with either. Try to stay optimistic in your thinking and in the meantime simply keep working hard. Your lungs need plenty of oxygen, so try to sleep in a well-ventilated room.",
      4: "You are probably conservative and perhaps find security in land or real estate or in old, traditional ways, beliefs, things or antiques. You may dislike change because of an unconscious fear of the unknown. You may have a desire to accumulate possessions, for security reasons. There may be many responsibilities and problems in your home or family life. You may be somewhat of a tyrant or strict disciplinarian in your home or with your family. Inner worries may cause ulcers. You may be a caretaker of someone or of your parents, perhaps because of a karmic debt to them. The later part of life can be more rewarding if you learn the lessons life has to teach you in your earlier years. If not, then old age may not be as pleasant.",
      5: "You perhaps feel unloved and unappreciated. Romances can turn cold. Love affairs are serious and you may feel emotionally and creatively inhibited. Because of your emotional restriction, you can appear to be cold, unloving, and unresponsive. This prevents you from being as popular as you would like to be. You have a desire for others to look up to you. It is difficult for you to relax. Personal interests and hobbies need to serve a practical purpose for you in order for you to enjoy them. Parenthood may be a burdensome responsibility and you may be too restrictive towards your kids. It is difficult for you to show your love and appreciation. You need to learn how to express your feelings towards those you love, and not just through the giving of presents and material things. It is important for you to forget yourself and to learn to project warmth to others.",
      6: "Obstructions of or limitations in health can come into play with this position. Diet may need to be watched and improved as your body may not assimilate everything it needs from the food you eat. Perhaps taking vitamins would help in this regard. Exercise would certainly be beneficial. There may be difficulties at the workplace, possibly because of your attitudes toward others. Perhaps the environment is not conducive to your best efforts or perhaps your fellow employees make life miserable for you. You cannot always expect others to work as hard as you or to grasp details as rapidly as you can. You may be a workaholic or you may simply need to learn how to work. In general, though, you are probably a practical, conscientious, hard worker who can work with details well. You may not be at your best with strict time deadlines, but you do try to always do your duty. Do not overwork to the point of exhaustion. The tendency to worry and to harbor anxieties may affect your health causing depression and perhaps hypochondria.",
      7: "There may be the tendency to attract older, more serious partners. Partnerships may involve much duty, responsibility and hard work. There may be a karmic tie from the past to the partners in this life. Whatever the case, there may be a feeling of restriction, bondage, depression and anxiety in your relationships. They certainly can be enduring, though. Saturn here indicates you need to learn to cooperate with and to develop empathy for others. You are perhaps cautious about marriage, but, when committed, may find it very difficult to leave your marriage partner, even if you are unhappy. You may marry for security rather than love. Discipline is needed in relationships. There may be a very self-controlled and sometimes calculating attitude towards all forms of partnership. You are inclined to seek a partner who will awaken your sense of responsibility and give you a greater sense of purpose and will to succeed. For a woman there may be a subconscious desire to marry a "father figure" and the partner may well feel an urge to organize your life on a more effective basis. The responsibilities of marriage or the fear of marriage may delay marriage. If Saturn is well aspected in your natal chart, then this position usually indicates that one loyally abides by marriage vows and faithfully carries out marital duties. With a well placed and well aspected natal Saturn, the partner is likely to be a person of integrity, faithful, steady, reliable, industrious, persevering and economical, perhaps not over-demonstrative and preferring deeds to words, and providing a real anchor for the partnership. If natal Saturn is badly aspected, then there is a tendency to endure an unhappy marriage rather than to lose face by breaking up. If you neglect to make your partner happy, your own happiness will be affected in the same proportion. This position can also mean a second choice marriage, which endures in spite of boredom, unhappiness and a lack of love. In other words you may have wanted to marry someone else but settled on a second choice instead. The partner may act in such a way as to become a burden, and may be uncommunicative, narrow in outlook, cold, and over-critical. In some cases the spouse may be much loved, but prone to ill health. Marriage to a widow or widower is possible.",
      8: "You are a hard worker who is patient and thrifty. You have the capacity for self-discipline and this strong discipline can cause you to deny yourself a social and/or sexual life in your quest for financial security. Transform this desire into seeking soul growth through understanding and wisdom, which can perhaps best be obtained through relating to others in partnership relationships. \"For what does it profit a man to gain the entire world and lose his own soul?\". There can also be issues concerning abuse, sex and power. A deep sense of hurt from the past may also be felt. Limitations, obstructions and problems may be experienced with inheritances, other people's money, one's sex life, taxes and insurance. Attitudes toward sex may cause difficulties. A strong sensual nature requires restraint.",
      9: "Your religious and philosophical beliefs are probably quite orthodox and traditional. You take these beliefs very seriously. Your concentration upon deep subjects is probably quite good. You may be intolerant and critical of others and their beliefs. You may question absolutes, God and religion in general. There may be difficulties connected with foreign travel or foreign cultures. Frustrations and delays can occur during long journeys. Take care not to deplete your energy to the point of exhaustion through over-concentration.",
      10: "You are self-reliant and independent with good business and organizing ability. Success for you comes slowly, through perseverance and hard work. You must accept your responsibilities, otherwise life will be a series of setbacks and failures. Chasing power and using others to get what you want will cause your downfall. You need to control your ambitions. Be careful of bridges you burn ? you may need to cross back over them. There may be difficulties with either parent because of their discipline, strictness or a need to control your life.",
      11: "Your religious and philosophical beliefs are probably quite orthodox and traditional. You take these beliefs very seriously. Your concentration upon deep subjects is probably quite good. You may be intolerant and critical of others and their beliefs. You may question absolutes, God and religion in general. There may be difficulties connected with foreign travel or foreign cultures. Frustrations and delays can occur during long journeys. Take care not to deplete your energy to the point of exhaustion through over-concentration.",
      12: "you are self-reliant and independent with good business and organizing ability. Success for you comes slowly, through perseverance and hard work. You must accept your responsibilities, otherwise life will be a series of setbacks and failures. Chasing power and using others to get what you want will cause your downfall. You need to control your ambitions. Be careful of bridges you burn – you may need to cross back over them. There may be difficulties with either parent because of their discipline, strictness or a need to control your life."
    }
    Uranus: {
      1: "You are strong-willed, independent, original, perhaps a bit eccentric, freedom-loving, and intuitive. You have an exciting and stimulating personality which tends to draw people to you. You may be willful, high-strung, nervous, and anxious. You may experience feelings of unrest and loneliness, perhaps because of the uniqueness you feel. Seeking new and unusual ways of expressing traditional ideas appeals to you. Listen to your intuition because it is probably very strong, or could be developed to a high degree. You can become a leader who will pioneer new paths for others to follow. You may be ahead of your time. You may not pay as much attention as you should to your physical state and appearance because of the myriad of thoughts that occupy your mind.",
      2: "You can earn money in original and inventive ways. Money and possessions come and go in sudden, unexpected ways. There may be unusual and disruptive changes in your financial condition. You may value money for the freedom it gives you to pursue your inner talents, which may be rare and unique. You have the ability to get yourself out of financial difficulties.",
      3: "Your mind is independent, original, creative, unconventional, curious, perhaps somewhat eccentric, and unusual. People around you sometimes cannot understand how you think or why you express yourself in the ways you do. You may be ahead of your time. Mental restlessness causes you to always be on the search for new information and knowledge. You have unique ways of passing this new information along to others. Frequent changes of mind are likely as new data filters through you. Relationships with siblings and neighbors are likely to be unusual and perhaps somewhat high-strung and tense at times. Boredom is seldom a problem. The desire for fresh experience may cause you to travel extensively. Intellectual freedom is important to you.",
      4: "You may experience unsettled home or family conditions. These events usually happen quite unexpectedly, out of the blue. Your family heritage may be eccentric or unusual and family skeletons can appear. This position gives restlessness, perhaps with a desire to move often. Your parent(s) or your relationship with either parent may be unusual, which will affect you emotionally (nerves) for good or otherwise. There will be many changes in your life, including different localities. You desire to remain free from commitments to either a home or a community. You may be unconventional and not interested in how others view you. Later in life, you may develop an interest in astrology or in metaphysics.",
      5: "You definitely possess creative originality. Your hobbies are unusual and interesting. Your desire for independence may make love affairs and relationships with children unsettling. Your children may be very unique, so much so that neither you nor they can understand the other. You are disinterested in society's social games and are more concerned about your own inclinations. Speculation can get you into trouble — be careful. Sudden gain and sudden loss are possible. Unexpected gains without any effort on your part can come to you, which may generate an attitude within that you just can't lose. Watch out for that. Your love life is unusual, sometimes maybe even wild. Your approach to romance and dating may be somewhat cavalier, unconventional and/or rebellious.",
      6: "You have unique abilities and original methods, especially in your work. You may suffer from extreme nervous tension and strange accidents on the job. Your appearance and manner of dress are apt to be quite unusual. You like the kind of work that has irregular hours, is different, and has a lot of variety. You are a good worker, but must watch out so that you do not overwork. You can develop clever ideas which will aid you in your work. You are at your best when you can be independent and be your own boss. You may be impatient with others and can appear to be abrupt to and detached from your fellow workers. Strange and unexpected turns in your health can occur. Spasmodic health is also a possibility. Many times the cause is simply nervousness, anxiety, stress, and tension. Relax.",
      7: "Your partnerships are unique or unusual, usually possessing a wonderful rapport or a total lack of understanding. You and/or your partner are generally unconventional and you do things for their shock appeal. Plenty of freedom is desired in the relationship and there may be a lack of desire for commitment. In fact, maybe you search out special situations in your relationships that ensure little commitment. Perhaps you are most attracted to those who are already in relationships or who are otherwise unavailable. Because of the uniqueness that exists within your partnerships, it is likely that others will not understand them. You may not understand them yourself. You meet the most interesting and unconventional people in your life. Any need to control the other person in your relationships will probably lead to disaster. Partner and you will have to find your own comfort level regarding time and attention spent on the other. A lot of elbow room may be required. A relationship in which you feel you are free to grow is one that makes it possible for you to do so. Any limits or constraints placed on the relationship are likely to be met with a certain hit the road attitude. Sudden and unexpected turns are likely. Perhaps one person is required to be away from the other for long periods of time. This position may give many long distance, casual types of relationships. You probably seek a partner who provides the thrills and spills for you in your life. A partner who challenges you mentally and emotionally is desired. Your relationships may be lab experiments where you hope to learn who-knows-what. Someone who is inventive, individualistic, creative, original, out-going, eccentric or radical appeals to you. Your partner may possess considerable personal magnetism and occasionally a degree of genius, but eccentricities, erratic tendencies and even fanaticism may be present. Your approach to marriage may be highly idealistic or utopian and there may be an inclination to favor platonic unions. You want and need your partner to be your friend. Most of your relationships probably started as friendships. On the other hand, there may be a tendency to seek excitement in partnerships and a marked interest in romantic adventures may result in passing infatuations that can cause a rift with the marriage partner. The greatest threat to marriage may occur when one partner's capacity for self-development expands at a rate greatly in excess of the other's, so that one spouse may no longer be recognizable as the person they were when the marriage took place. For a successful partnership, you and your partner will need to develop the qualities of tolerance, cooperation, detachment and freedom.",
      8: "You have strong psychic feelings and a keen intuition. You perhaps have unconventional ideas about life, sex and death, which you do not necessarily reveal. The afterlife is a great mystery for you and you may seek to probe for answers. The occult sciences in general may intrigue you. You may experience difficulties through nervous tension. Sudden loss or gain could come about with other people's resources. There can be an unexpected inheritance or financial gain through unusual sources. Be careful around electricity and machinery. An interest in healing, perhaps through the laying on of hands, attends this position. You may have entertained thoughts of suicide in earlier years.",
      9: "Your thinking, ideas and philosophies are original, offbeat, independent and unorthodox. There may be a desire to study metaphysics or a fringe religion or foreign culture. Sudden and unexpected long journeys are possible. Mental journeys in the form of dreams, visions, intuition and prophecies are possible. Your mind ever seeks to expand, gain knowledge and journey where it has never gone before. Too much mental activity, though, can cause nervousness and perhaps lead to a mental breakdown.",
      10: "You are not a conformer and do not wish a career that is stable, uneventful and commonplace. You are highly independent and may wish to be self-employed. Your rebellious nature may cause you to do the opposite of what you are told to do in your line of work. Your strong imagination, intuition and creativity will be applied to any career you choose. Sudden changes in job fortune are probable. Routine work drives you batty. A career in electronics, computers, invention, metaphysics or mechanics is possible.",
      11: "You are intuitive, original, inventive and creative. Humanitarian ideals are important to you. Unusual friendships with unusual people are indicated. Friendships, goals and dealings with groups can change rather suddenly. You make friends easily, but prefer many acquaintances with only a few intimate friends. Your friends may see you as being somewhat aloof. You could be quite a rebel or reformer and it would be best if you use these energies along constructive lines rather than the opposite.",
      12: "You tend to be highly intuitive and secretive, with humanitarian ideals. You may have feelings of loneliness. There may be nervous difficulties. There is interest in metaphysical subjects. You may have unique psychic experiences which you keep to yourself for fear of being ridiculed. You have a tremendous desire to feel free and a constant questioning of the meaning of life and of the imperfections you see around you. Unresolved difficulties in your subconscious mind need to be brought out and disposed of. You have a tendency to feel that something is going to get you, to sneak up on you, if you are not careful. It is as though you always have a sense of impending doom. You need to overcome this apprehension. Self-control must be developed."
    }
    Neptune: {
      1: "You tend to be artistic, idealistic, dreamy, procrastinating, psychic, and very (hyper)sensitive to your environment. Getting lost in your own imagination can sometimes make you moody, frustrated, unstable or impractical. You may be a sucker for the sob stories of those who feel down and out. You may enjoy playing the role of savior, or of martyr. The day-to-day pressures of the world can drive you away and into your own little world. Be sure you do not get lost in it. You still have to live and function on this earth plane. Your physical body may be susceptible to all sorts of real or imagined ailments. You are like a sponge and can soak up the influences of the environments you are in. So be careful what you surround yourself with. Watch any medicine you take because a little probably goes a long way for you. Perhaps the secret for you is to lose your ego so that you will find yourself.",
      2: "You have a strong imagination and psychic sensitivity which can be used to tap your inner talents. You receive intuitive hunches and are apt to have vivid dreams. You have an appreciation of beautiful objects. You seldom worry about money, which may be just as well, since your finances can be complicated and sometimes confusing. This placement can tend to make you extremely generous or extremely dishonest. If dishonesty is present, you will experience losses through theft, fraud and deception. Do everything on the up-and-up and money matters will go smoother. Avoid risky speculations and investments. Be completely honest with respect to money matters.",
      3: "You are idealistic and artistic. Your mind soaks up information rather than acquiring it by brute force. Your ability to visualize and imagine is probably quite pronounced. Flashes of inspiration can come to you quite suddenly. There may even be traces of clairvoyance. Perhaps you have felt as if you could read people’s minds? Concentration on book work may be difficult for you. Did you ever try sleeping with the book under your pillow? Possible karmic obligations to siblings or neighbors may need to be reconciled. Some feelings of insecurity may cause nervous disorders. You may have a tendency to be unreliable or negative. Avoid procrastination and idle day-dreaming. Avoid all negative psychic practices and drugs.",
      4: "You may experience a sense of inner uncertainty, insecurity and confusion. Unexplainable fears and anxieties may cause you to withdraw from living. You idealize the home environment and it may be, in reality, more in your imagination rather than in fact. A spiritual tie with one or both parents is likely. A desire to live by the sea is not uncommon with this position. You may have vague recollections regarding your true roots and this uncertainty may cause difficulties. Remember, with Neptune, things are not as they appear and you need to face reality in your home environment and with respect to your parents rather than what may be in your imagination and sub-conscious.",
      5: "You are artistic and creative. You have a flare for the dramatic and perhaps love being on stage. You like playing the role of the entertainer. Chaotic love affairs with much confusion can be experienced or love affairs just seem to dissolve for no particular reason. In matters of love you can be the hopeless romantic or the one who is constantly looking for that white knight or princess to sweep you off your feet. Idealism is fine, but don't lose your practicality or let your imagination run away with you. Your children may be unusual. Perhaps they require some special care. Great sacrifices can be made for children and love interests, but little may be gained in return.",
      6: "Strange things can happen at the workplace or to your health. You seek to serve and to perhaps nurse and take care of others. Sometimes it may be difficult for you to get started on your work or to work logically and systematically in order to get the job done. In your work, you may encounter people who are two-faced, causing you pain and suffering. You are extremely sensitive to your workplace conditions and you need pleasant and peaceful surroundings. If these are not present, then you may experience unusual health difficulties, some of which may be real and some of which are only in your head. You are a psychic sponge that absorbs the atmosphere around you. Herbal healing or holistic techniques may work better for you than traditional medical techniques. You are capable of making great sacrifices in your work. Just don't play the martyr.",
      7: "There may be a tendency to idealize marriage or the marriage partner. Many sacrifices may be made for the spouse. The marriage partner can be spiritually minded, artistic or just plain confusing. Communication may be a problem due to your concepts and ideals not coinciding. There is the tendency to attract a partner whereby you or they play the role of martyr or savior. The feeling may be that your partner needs saving and that you're the only one who can save (change) them. Because of this your partner may be an alcoholic or a drug (ab)user. Your imagination and your idealization of your partner may be more real to you than what your partner is in reality. If this is so, then there will come the day when your blinders are removed and you will see their true nature. This then may lead to great disappointment and discouragement when you find out that they or you have been living a lie and that things are not as they have appeared. With this position you must make absolutely sure you are dealing with the hard, cold facts of your relationship and not the romantic notions dreamed up from storybook tales. You are likely to seek a marriage partner who can provide a source of inspiration and bring out your capacity for compassion and loving understanding. There can be a tendency to see a prospective partner through rose-colored glasses or to weave imaginative fantasies about new contacts or hoped-for encounters. Consequently there is a possibility that the partner may not be the type of person conjured up by your imagination. There is some tendency to form partnerships based on admiration or pity. If your natal Neptune is afflicted, such admiration may have resulted from your having been dazzled by glamorous externals, while an over-active sense of pity may be exploited by a prospective partner so that you marry out of sentiment or misplaced sympathy. Possibilities exist that the partner is very sensitive and may need to be treated with kid gloves. The partner may be artistic or musically inclined or have some connection with drama or the stage. The material side of life may not concern them. Your relationship may be quite spiritual and above the sordid things of this life, hence it may be more platonic than sexual. The other side of the coin is that you may become involved with unreliable, inconstant and somewhat shiftless types whose sympathies may be largely focused upon themselves, or they may be underprivileged in some way, or neurotic or invalids suffering from chronic ill health. An unconscious willingness on your part to indulge in self-deception regarding your partner is possible. This may keep you in a bad relationship because you refuse to see the truth or you falsely believe that only you can change things. In order to get the best results from the marriage relationship you must learn to overcome vague desires for an unattainable ideal, to control any tendency to get carried away by shallow romanticism and to be as clear-headed and practical as possible when assessing the virtues and attractions of prospective mates. Stay well-grounded.",
      8: "You are psychic and intuitive, with dreams and visions which may be precognitive. You may have extreme sensitivity to the feelings of others. If you are not honest, you will suffer financial reverses in order to prove the futility of seeking happiness through material possessions. An interest in life after death and natural healing through the laying on of hands is possible. Be honest and above board in all dealings with taxes, insurance and all money matters.",
      9: "You tend to be idealistic, reverent, mystical and philosophical. You are drawn to ideas that espouse the oneness of all life and the idea of the immortal life of the Spirit. Dreams can be very vivid and possibly prophetic. If carried too far, your religious or metaphysical beliefs could border on fanaticism. Good judgment in these areas can be clouded and confused. Exaggeration can be present. Trouble with in-laws may surface due to lack of compassion and understanding. Be careful who you choose to follow as you may encounter wolves in sheep’s clothing. In your travels you prefer to wander around on your own without too much planning or forethought. Strange, unforeseen things can occur while traveling long distances.",
      10: "Strange and confusing things can happen with respect to your career and your drive to be successful within it. Strong idealism attends this position so keep your eyes open with your feet on the ground. Your career may involve something artistic, inspirational, humanitarian, dramatic, promotional or psychic. The theater, chemistry, psychic activities, photography or dealings with drugs are possible career outlets. Your public image may have its ups and downs due to forces beyond your control. A feeling of rejection by one or both parents is possible.",
      11: "You are idealistic and interested in the common good. Strong hunches regarding your hopes and wishes are present. Because the influence of Neptune is elusive, there may be difficulty deciding upon your goals. Just dreaming about them will not bring them about. Friends may be weird, wacky, spiritual, unreliable, or deceitful, but probably artistic or of a musical bent. Be careful with some friends as they may not be what they seem. Some may want to introduce you to drugs or alcohol so be objective and clear-headed. Definite, practical and concrete goals with a firm faith in the future are called for. Then your dreams can come true.",
      12: "You are reflective and intuitive. You have psychic ability which operates unconsciously. You may experience intense feelings of loneliness and of being held in bondage to a specific person. You feel a need to connect with a higher Power and to be part of the oneness of all life. There is interest in occult and mystical subjects. Serving those in some kind of confinement is a possibility. Serve or suffer may be a keynote in your life. Secret enemies may try to undermine you. Forgiveness, love and compassion need to be expressed and lived."

    Pluto: {
      1: "You are strong-willed, brave, self-sufficient and probably enjoy throwing your weight around. Yet you may lack self-confidence. Controlling others may become an issue for you. You crave experience and transformation. Regeneration is a topic that occupies your thoughts. There is a magnetism that surrounds you that draws other people to you, yet you may be a loner whom others find difficult to understand. You can be gentle and sensitive, yet will always fight for what you believe in. You don't back down from anyone. You are capable of great anger under the right circumstances and when this occurs, you can go off like an A-bomb. You may be a channel for healing and can perhaps develop this ability should you decide. Forgive and forget and don't brood over slights, whether real or imaginary. Trying to be a little more flexible wouldn't hurt either.",
      2: "You have financial ability with keen judgment, patience, energy, and will. You may possess unusual talents. This placement may give an inordinate desire for money and possessions. Watch the tendency to view loved ones as possessions. You may see money coming and going in order to de-emphasize its importance. Detachment may be necessary. You must learn to spontaneously share all possessions with others. Integrity in money matters is essential. Others may seek to control your resources and possessions or you may be quite demanding and controlling with your own resources, monetary and otherwise.",
      3: "Your mind is versatile, inspired, probing and original. You perhaps have a keen ability to size up people and circumstances. You are probably good at understanding people's true motives. You want to know the answers to all your many questions. Research and figuring out puzzles or brain teasers may appeal to you. Perhaps you enjoy playing detective. You may be searching for that something that will give meaning to your life or searching for that area that will help you regenerate yourself or your thinking. Frustration, depression or anxiety may arise when the answers you seek are not forth-coming. Keep at it! Expressing yourself in writing may help alleviate the tension. This may help purify your thoughts, then allow new thoughts to enter. Once your thoughts and feelings have been purged, you may want to destroy the material as its purpose has been served.",
      4: "You may have a good imagination and intuitive ability. There is a desire for a loving home atmosphere, yet power struggles and a desire to wear the pants in the family may cause problems. The influence of one or both parents is strong for good or ill. Perhaps one or both are manipulative or controlling. You may possess an explosive temper due to the inner tension at home. You may feel restless in the place of your birth. The home may be your place for regeneration.",
      5: "You have unusual talents and hobbies. Great creativity and self-expression is possible. Your children may be unique and it may be difficult for you to understand them or for them to understand you. There may be too much emphasis on sex in romantic relationships and issues of power and control can surface therein. There is an inner drive to be creative and it would be best if this creativity were not channeled through sex. Find a creative hobby instead.",
      6: "Great personal transformations can occur because of your work or your workplace environment. You may have the desire to become involved in workplace issues or labor union goings-on. You strive for cooperation and thoroughness in your work habits and you can be a hard taskmaster for fellow employees or for the workers under your command. Guard against trying to be too controlling of how they work. You have the ability to work long hours on nervous energy until your body cannot take any more. You enjoy troubleshooting and solving problems that others cannot solve. Detective work on the job is fun for you. You have the ability to encourage people to discuss deep-seated problems and then analyze the problems logically. There may be an interest in healing. You could be a channel for healing or you might simply be a hypochondriac. You are apt to unconsciously project criticalness to fellow workers without speaking. There may be difficulties through infectious, deep-seated diseases or problems in the colon area.",
      7: "Control and power issues along with feelings of ownership are present with the partner or spouse. Cooperation with the mate will need to be learned. A partner may be selected based on that person's ability to stand their ground and not give in. A partner such as this could make the relationship very combative and competitive rather than harmonious and equal-sided. You are inclined to seek a partner who will provide a challenge to discover new resources within yourself that will give you the power to transcend previous performances and to transform certain aspects of your being.
